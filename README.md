# Data Analysis and Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project involves comprehensive data analysis and model building for predicting customer churn. Below are the main stages of the work completed:

### 1. Data Extraction and Preparation

- **Data Extraction**: Data was successfully extracted from the SQL Server database and prepared for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - **Data Cleaning**: Unnecessary columns were removed, and data formats were converted.
  - **Categorical Variable Transformation**: Categorical variables were converted to a numeric format using one-hot encoding.
  - **Normalization**: Numeric variables were normalized to improve model performance.

### 2. Model Training and Evaluation

- **Model Training**:
  - Built and trained several machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Models were assessed on training and test data.
  - **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Hyperparameters were optimized using RandomizedSearchCV to enhance model performance.
  - **Metric Analysis**: Metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1-Score were calculated and analyzed.

### 3. Predictions on New Data

- **Applying Models**: Trained models were used to predict customer churn on new data.
- **Prediction Analysis**: Results included churn probability and classification of customers.

### 4. Visualization in Power BI

- **Report Creation**: Interactive reports and visualizations were created in Power BI to demonstrate model performance and prediction results.
- **Result Analysis**: Charts and tables were built to visually represent the results and enhance understanding of the data.

The project achieved significant results in data analysis and machine learning model building, enabling effective customer churn prediction and informed decision-making.
